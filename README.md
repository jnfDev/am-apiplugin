# Boilerplate Plugin

## Description
This plugin is a starting point for creating any plugin that relied in modern PHP development, such as OOP, Composer, and PHPUnit.

## How to use it?
Just clone this repo and run `composer install`, then rename classes and folder based on your needs. That's it. ðŸ˜‰

## Contribution?
Umm, not really, it's just a personal project, however, if you still want it, just create a PR and I'll take a look.
